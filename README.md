## What is 30 seconds of code?
30 seconds of code provides short JavaScript, CSS, React, Python, Node.js, and Git code snippets for all your development needs.

Code snippets can include common tasks in a certain language, such as merging a list in Python, or it could be commonly asked questions, such as what iterators in Javascript are used for and how to use them. Each code snippet also provides a brief description of the process of question, and then demonstrates the question to answer in a practical code snippet, which is able to be copy-pasted for personal use with appropriate credit to 30 seconds of code.

Code snippets are also tagged by algorithm/data structure such as array, string, etc., and are sorted by tag within each language's collection.

* Visit [our website](https://30secondsofcode.org) to view our snippet collection.
* Use the [Search page](https://30secondsofcode.org/search) to find snippets that suit your needs. You can search by name, tag, language or using a snippet's description. Just start typing a term and see what comes up.
* Browse the [JavaScript Snippet collection](https://30secondsofcode.org/js/p/1) to see all the snippets in this project or click individual tags at the top of the same page to narrow down your search to a specific tag.
* Click on each snippet card to view the whole snippet, including code, explanation and examples.
* You can use the button at the bottom of a snippet card to copy the code to clipboard.
* If you like the project, give it a star. It means a lot to the people maintaining it.
